# Generating jokes based on reddit's subreddit r/jokes with PyTorch

The goal is to train a language model based on jokes in order to generate jokes with some hint of humor.

Curent code is heavily based upon the sequence to sequence [tutorial](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html).

*I am not responsible for the quality or nature of these jokes, some of them are insensitive. At testing time, insensitive jokes will be filtered.*
